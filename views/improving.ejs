        <h3>Tips & Tricks</h3>
        <p>If it does not take years to crack your password, you should consider making it stronger using some of these tips: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Make it longer!</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Making your password longer increases the time to crack exponentially. This is the reason most websites require you to have a password of at least 8 characters. </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Use different symbols and numbers. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding these two things to your password will make it infinitely harder to guess since you are adding </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Use different passwords between websites</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Even if your password does end up compromised on one website, you donâ€™t want the attacker to be able to gain access to your accounts everywhere using the same password. By changing your password between websites, you are mitigating risk of giving the attacker access to everything you have. </li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <li>Try to change passwords every so often</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Like using different passwords, changing your password will expose you to less risk of being hacked. </li>
          </ul>
        </ul>
